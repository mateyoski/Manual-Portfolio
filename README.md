Introduction
Hey, my name is Maciek. I graduated from AGH UST as master in the field of power engineering. 
My professional work related to this area consisted of designing appliances such as boilers or heat exchangers,
including the design process, technical documentation and drawings. It included close communication with colleagues,
clients as well as end users to develop devices suitable for their everyday use. However, it wasn't something I truly wanted to do,
which is why at some point I started diverging towards IT.
I am learning manual application testing.
At this point in time I have plenty of experience doing crowdtesting on the uTest platform.
Something I am putting extra time into is software security and networks.
